# LibraryBookRentalCost
This program calculates the cost of rental book based on the due date.

This include the explanation of the above code :

Suppose User1 issues 3 books i.e. (x,y,z) on three different dates.

For instance assume book x was issued on 3/06/2021
so the return date of book x is 7 days after the issue date i.e. 10/06/2021.
if the book is returned after 10th then cost $1 is added for each respective days till the actual return date.
so suppose actual return date is of 9/07/2021 so the fine will be $29 i.e. the difference between return date vs actual return date. (9/07/2021 - 10/06/2021)
